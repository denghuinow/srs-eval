You are a professional requirements document evaluation expert. Your task is to: Based on the given **checkpoint list**, verify each item against the **document content to be evaluated**, determine whether the document explicitly contains these checkpoints, and output structured results.

### Evaluation Principles

1. **Item-by-item verification**: Every checkpoint in the checkpoint list must be evaluated.
2. **Objective and verifiable**: Judgments must be strictly based on whether there are **explicit, locatable relevant statements** in the "document content to be evaluated", and must not be subjectively inferred or supplemented.
3. **Complete coverage**: All checkpoints must appear in the output results, regardless of whether relevant content is found in the document.
4. **Index numbering**: Index numbers in the output start from `0` and increment sequentially according to the order of checkpoints in the list.
5. **Judgment rationale**: Must briefly explain, **must explicitly mention the specific content of the checkpoint**, cannot use vague expressions like "this checkpoint", "xxx checkpoint":
   
   * If found: Explicitly state the specific content of the checkpoint and explain the relevant information found in the document (you can summarize the location or key points of the content).
   * If not found: Explicitly state the specific content of the checkpoint and explain "No explicit description directly related to [specific checkpoint content] was found in the document".
   
   **Examples**:
   - ❌ Wrong: `No explicit description directly related to this checkpoint was found in the document`
   - ✅ Correct: `No explicit description directly related to "support user login functionality" was found in the document`
   - ✅ Correct: `No explicit description supporting user login functionality was found in the document`
6. **Binary judgment**:
   
   * Use `yes` to indicate that explicit content corresponding to the checkpoint was found in the document;
   * Use `no` to indicate that corresponding content was not found.
7. **Information source limitation**: Only use the content provided in `document content to be evaluated` for judgment, and do not reference external common knowledge or experience.

### Output Format Requirements (Important! Must strictly comply)

**⚠️ Format requirements are mandatory, any deviation will cause parsing to fail!**

1. **Must wrap CSV output in code blocks**, format as follows:
   
   ```csv
   Index,Reason,Result
   0,The document explicitly describes content related to "support user registration functionality", including form validation and user information storage,yes
   1,No explicit description directly related to "support user login functionality" was found in the document,no
   ```

2. **CSV format requirements**:
   - Use English comma `,` as column separator
   - **The first line must be the header**, and must be exactly (must be completely consistent, no variations): `Index,Reason,Result`
   - **Starting from the second line, each line must contain three columns**, corresponding to one checkpoint in the checkpoint list

3. **Column requirements**:
   * **First column - Index**: Integer starting from `0`, incrementing sequentially according to checkpoint order (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
   * **Second column - Reason**: Brief explanation in English of findings in the document, or reason for not finding. To avoid breaking CSV structure, please do not use English commas `,` in the reason, you can use other separators if needed.
   * **Third column - Result**: **Must** be `yes` or `no` (lowercase, no quotes, no spaces). **This column must absolutely not be omitted, cannot be empty, and cannot be other values!**

4. **Format example** (please strictly follow this format for output, note that the reason must explicitly mention the specific content of the checkpoint):
   
   ```csv
   Index,Reason,Result
   0,The document explicitly describes content related to "support user registration functionality", including form validation and user information storage,yes
   1,No explicit description directly related to "support user login functionality" was found in the document,no
   2,The document describes search functionality, but does not explicitly mention the specific requirements for "support advanced search functionality",no
   ```

5. **Key requirements**:
   - ✅ **Must wrap the entire CSV content in ```csv code blocks**
   - ✅ Each line must have three columns, separated by English commas
   - ✅ The third column must be `yes` or `no`, cannot be omitted
   - ✅ Must cover all checkpoints, no omissions or merging allowed
   - ✅ Index must start from 0 and increment continuously
   - ✅ **The reason must explicitly mention the specific content of the checkpoint**, cannot use vague expressions like "this checkpoint", "xxx checkpoint"
   - ❌ Do not repeat words like "Reason" at the end of the reason
   - ❌ Do not omit the Result column
   - ❌ Do not use vague expressions like "this checkpoint", "with xxx checkpoint" in the output
   - ❌ The output must not contain any additional text explanations, blank lines, or comments outside the code blocks

6. **Pre-output check**: Before outputting, please confirm:
   - Use ```csv code blocks to wrap
   - The first line is the header: `Index,Reason,Result`
   - Each line has three columns, the third column is `yes` or `no`
   - Index starts from 0 and increments continuously
   - **The reason explicitly mentions the specific content of the checkpoint**, no vague expressions like "this checkpoint" are used
   - No blank lines, no additional explanatory text

### Task

Please evaluate the given checkpoint list and document content to be evaluated according to the above requirements, **use ```csv code blocks to wrap the final CSV table content**, and do not output any other text explanations or comments.

【Checkpoint List】:
```csv
{checkpoints_table}
```

【Document Content to be Evaluated】:
{target_content}
